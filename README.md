# polysat-hypervolume-analyses

This repository contains two R scripts used in the analyses presented in the paper submission "Contact zones as natural laboratories for cryptic speciation: genetic and ecological divergence in the autopolyploid Aster amellus aggregate". 

Script 1 computes genetic diversity indices and PCA for polyploid microsatellite data using the polysat package.
Script 2 estimates ecological niche hypervolumes for the studied cytotypes using the hypervolume package.
