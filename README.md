This repository contains two R scripts used in the analyses presented in the paper submission "Contact zones as natural laboratories for cryptic speciation: genetic and ecological divergence in the autopolyploid Aster amellus aggregate". 

--> aster_polysat_analysis.R computes genetic diversity indices, generates data for programs such as STRUCTURE or GENODIVE; and computes PCA for polyploid microsatellite data using the polysat package.

--> aster_niche_analysis.R estimates ecological niche hypervolumes for the studied cytotypes using the hypervolume package.

--> The scrips_data folder contains the input and the output data of the analyses.
